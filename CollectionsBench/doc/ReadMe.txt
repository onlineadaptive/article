Container Benchmarks

Here we present the container benchmarks we considered when selecting collections libraries to test.
It also helped us come up with methodologies for analyzing the performance and the memory usage of collections.

Some key insights we gained from this were that, as expected, every single benchmark analyzed the JCF in order to
come up with a baseline to compare its results too. We also noticed that the scientific soundness of the benchmarks
varied quite a bit.

Files:
ExaminedLibraries.txt            - a list of the libraries we benchmarked, their version and where they can be downloaded
ExaminedLibraries.cvs            - as above
BenchmarkMethodology.txt         - a table showing which operations tested what libraries in which benchmarks, as well as the results of our ranking
BenchmarkMethodology.cvs         - the table of operations tested on what libraries in which benchmarks
BenchmarkMethodology_Results.cvs - the results of the ranking resulting from these benchmarks
Summary.xlsx                     - a summary containing all three tables: libraries examined, benchmark methodology and results

## Contents
* The code for the data structure Online Adaptive which was created to perform the experiment in the article. 
* The code for the microbenchmarks used to evaluate the performance of the data structure. The code uploaded here is forked from the repo [CollectionsBench](https://github.com/DiegoEliasCosta/CollectionsBench) by Diego Costa. Some new benchmarks are added that are used with the framework created by Costa. 
* A folder with the results from our experiments. Both in tabular form and as graphs that can be seen in the article.
